## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - 2025-01-08

### Added
- Initial alpha release of Sub Agent Continue MCP server
- Core MCP server implementation enabling sub-agents to continue with parent agent context
- Two primary tools:
  - `getCurrentConversation`: Retrieve current conversation with filtering
  - `getCurrentConversationUpto`: Retrieve conversation up to a specific user message
- Filter presets are specified as tool parameters (no environment variable support)
- Eight filter presets: none, light, heavy (default), smart, minimal, moderate, aggressive, development
- Advanced filtering options:
  - Skip tool calls by type
  - Skip sub-agent messages
  - Skip reasoning/thinking blocks
  - Remove XML tags
  - Limit conversation depth
- LRU cache for improved performance
- Comprehensive test suite with 227 tests
- Security features:
  - Path validation to prevent directory traversal
  - File size limits (100MB max)
  - Input sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Graceful shutdown handling
- TypeScript support with full type definitions
- Documentation:
  - Quick reference guide
  - Claude Code logging architecture
  - Filtering logic documentation

### Security
- Added path validation to ensure files are only read from ~/.claude directory
- Added file size validation to prevent memory exhaustion
- Added input sanitization for project paths
- Added rate limiting to prevent request flooding

### Performance
- Implemented LRU cache for parsed conversations
- Added performance monitoring with timing metrics
- Optimized XML parsing and filtering

### Testing
- 87.45% code coverage
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Tests for real-world conversation logs

### Known Issues
- Server startup logging goes to stderr (by design for MCP protocol)
- Cache size is not configurable via environment variables (planned for future release)

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2025-01-08

### Added
- Comprehensive "How It Works" section explaining both getCurrentConversation tools
- Key benefits documentation: context inheritance, cost savings, clean context management  
- Specific use cases: lint-agents, planning-agents, side tasks
- Sample sub-agent creation prompt template for users

### Changed
- Enhanced README with sub-agent workflow explanation and usage examples

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Configurable cache size via environment variables
- Streaming support for very large conversation files
- Additional filter presets for common use cases
- Web UI for testing and debugging
- Support for multiple conversation formats
- Conversation search and query capabilities
